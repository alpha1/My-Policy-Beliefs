## My beliefs
This are rough ideas but form some of my core policy beliefs. It is not a exhaustive list, some I will not post publicly, others I just haven't gotten to adding or articulating yet.
Pull requests welcome, for idea ideas or clarifications. 
Formerly at a gist: https://gist.github.com/alpha1/20f54715e307184304f7
1) Outlaw Unpaid Internships. Interns may work no more than 20 hours a week. Intern minimum wage is $7.25. Limited to 3 months of work. Companies cannot have more than 10% of their workforce be interns at any given time. Exceptions available by permit.
Enforce for any company, its subsidaries, or any company it owns 33% or more of.
2a) Split Minimum wage. Under 18 or 21, minimum wage increased to 10.10. Over 18 or 21, minimum wage is $15 an hour. Impose heavy fines for companies hiring more than X percent under 21, and age discrimination.
2b) Remove Obamacare penalites for part time workers, minimum wage workers, and families on or below 125% of the povertly line.
3) Penalties for companies that use majority (66%) part time labor (Fees applied to companies with 10 employees or more, older than 1 year). Fees equal to the pay of employees wages needed to bring the full time workforce to 66%. 
4) No Bonus, Dividends, Incentives, corporate gifts, stock options, preformance pay, or anything else, until every single employee is above the povertly line and items 1, 2, and 3 are met. Enforce for any company, its subsidaries, or any company it owns 33% or more of.
5) Outlaw On-Call for more than 20% of a worker's time. Require 24 hours notice for change in hours. Gaurentee overtime for anyone making under 60k, no exceptions. Guarentee pay for workers sent home for due to weather or other workplace closing. Applicable employees can be made to work from home.
6) permenant Jobs requiring workers to call in less than 24 hours before a shift begins to see if they need to come in must pay a minimum of 2 hours wage or 25% of the wages that would be earned on a shift (a 12 hour shift would pay for 3 hours). This only applies if you are required to call or check in, not if you are called in. This does not apply in the case of weather emergenies when you have to call in to see if the business is open. 
7) Remove all campaign funding. Replace with time constrained (X per month) government funding for canidates that can register as a canidate and qualify by collecting the signatures of 10% (15? 20?) of the population they would represent
8a) Education Reform: Raise standards, reduce testing. Evaulations should be based on school year grades, rather than testing. Bring skills training into high schools, 1 semester of skills, from workworking, engineering, programming, to cooking, and assemble lines and factory workers.

13) Reform drug small drug posession and usage sentening. Short prison term with addiction dependence treatment, and consuling beyond the use of drugs but to underlying problems that turn people to drugs. Continue consuling outside of prison. Punishments should be fines and community service. Distrubuting based offenses, and violence drug related offenses should face increased prison sentences and increased parole / probation. 
14) Jail time for driving offenses - driving without a licences should result in a prison term. Any penalities for crimes committed while driving without a licences should be doubled. Multiple licences suspentions should result in a lifetime ban.

28) An Alternative minimum federal business tax - 10%
29) A federally enforced state income tax: if you're state does not have an income tax, your income is taxed federally at 1% and distributed to your state. This will help the problem of blue states subsidizing red states who use federal funds because they don't have state funds. Applies to both businesses and individuals.
